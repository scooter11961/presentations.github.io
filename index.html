            <p>"The definition of Quality Assurance has been changing rapidly in the software industry. In a few
                short
                years, we have gone from a model where requirements, and testing procedures where created months in
                advance,
                and waterfall release cycles created a back-and-forth bug fix cycle between development, and
                testing. In
                today's fast paced software industry, Agile teams are demanding more of us in terms of delivery,
                speed to
                market, and of course, still quality! This is a talk about what some teams have found useful to
                perform at
                this new level."
