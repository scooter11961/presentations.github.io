## Hi, I'm Scott
---

### This is ...
* A quick way to introduce a little bit about me, and how I approach things
* Answer some likely questions
* Set expectations about what you can depend on from me as your coworker
* A owner's manual of sorts, or a "manager readme" for anyone who works directly for me

### This isn't ...
* Laying out my expectations for you
* My plans for our organization and its products
* Going to cover everything. Because, one of us likely just got here. I'm guessing we have much to learn about each other, and this job too

### Stuff to know
* I live in Arvada with my wife, and we have two grown kids (in their 20's),
* There is a dog (Bella, English Springer Spaniel), and a cat (Penny, Calico) that is "just visiting"
* I was born and raised in Colorado
* I like travel, camping/hiking/fishing, geocaching, cooking, grilling, and dining

### Why this company?
I first noticed Ibotta at Denver startup week. As I talked with people, I began to learn about their commitment to great engineering culture, and an amazing product / business model, I want to work at a high tech company that delivers something that people can use to impact their daily life

Ibotta has heart and cares about people. Diversity, inclusion, investment are core values at Ibotta, trust and excellence is part of the culture

This particular role for me is exciting, humbling, and gives me a place to bring all of my professional experiences together

### Work style differences != personality conflicts
* We may at times have substantive disagreements
* When it comes to making adjustments to personalities, I strongly believe that the person in the more senior position is getting paid, partially, to adjust to the personality styles of the people on their team
* Relationships are healthy when there is politeness, and an assumption of "positive intent" when we interpret the words of someone else
* By the way, Myers-Briggs profiles say I'm a DEFENDER (ISFJ-A)

### My Job
At a minimum:
* Is to attract and retain world-class talent (that's you)
* Set context

If I do something that negatively impacts my ability to retain you, you would be doing me a huge favor if you let me know about it, as soon as possible
If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job rather than setting context, you'd be doing me a huge favor if you let me know about it, as soon as possible

### On Feedback
I love feedback. Feedback is critical to my success here, both to you, and from you

Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give valuable feedback:
* Safety should be high (no fear of retaliation)
* Effort should be low (no rebuttals)
* Benefit should be high (positive results)

Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions

### Want to Talk? Let's Talk
* I've got a few things to do around here
* Very few of them are more important than spending time talking with you if you want to talk with me
* Feel entirely free to try to catch me ad-hoc via Slack or in person, or put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want
* You may not find a slot on my calendar in any given day
* If you want to talk, let's talk
* Let me know via Slack or phone and I'll make time

### One on Ones (1:1s)

* 1:1s are for you first, me second
* 1:1s are not for status updates unless you want to update status
* I'd like to try 30 minutes each week
* I'd like to keep a shared journal for notes, follow up items, etc.
* I'll bring an item or two to talk about, but the agenda is what is on your mind first

Your daily work tasks will come largely from the feature Squad you are on - so our chats will be less about status of your work, and more about how the work culture is going, how I can be a sounding board for your ideas, and if there's anything I can do to guide you, coach you, or do anything else that will help you grow as a software engineer

If we ever need to cancel a 1:1, we can reschedule for another day that same week, or get caught up the following week. Your choice

### Being bossy
One way of describing my leadership style is that I strive to provide "context, not control". I've come to value this because I too, have been micro-managed in the past, and am striving to learn and practice better ways of leadership

I'm likely to be reserved in expressing opinions about what/how you should be doing (But I'll never avoid a direct question or request for advice)

I have opinions, lots of them, but trust in you and your ability to achieve will be high. Accountability to commitments is how we measure contribution

### Our relationship is an alliance
I'm planning on our relationship being a mutually beneficial deal for both of us. The goal is to add value to each other, and we will help each other be successful. I will help you grow in your career and help you become more valuable to Ibotta while you make Ibotta successful. Our alliance may take on several forms, and we should be clear with each other on how we help each other's success

For more on the **Alliance Framework** and an alliance as a manager/employee relationship, check out http://www.theallianceframework.com/ - Reid Hoffman from linkedin created the framework, and I've found a lot of value in using this as a framework to describe how I work with people in my organization*

### Balance independence and coaching
Your success relies on your independence and autonomy. My role as a leader is to provide a framework you can work in (e.g. help define clarity for your role and mission), and then get out of your way. Ibotta employees are capable of working with others and figuring things out - I'm here for guidance, coaching, and to help otherwise as needed. If you have questions - or need advice - or just someone to bounce an idea off of, I'm always available.

I will also step in and apply additional guidance from time to time. It doesn't mean you've made a mistake or you're doing something wrong - it just means that I spotted an opportunity where I think I can help you.

*The One Minute Manager https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_Minute_Manager also covers a lot of this philosophy*

### Improvement is a Priority
I use two different frameworks to think about employee growth. The first is from Max Landsberg/Michael Lopp's fantastic book, Managing Humans (http://managinghumans.com/). It's a **Quadrant of skill and will**. You may spend time in each of the parts of the quadrant from time to time, but my role as a leader / manager is to guide you towards high skill, high will work as much as possible. This is where you provide the most value to Ibotta, and where your strengths and skills grow the fastest

_Quadrant of skill and will_

The other model I use is highly related. Its called the **ACM framework (Ambitious, Comfortable, Mundane)**. The idea is that if you look at the work you do over a week / sprint, some of that work is new, challenging, or ambitious, a big chunk of work is stuff that you're just really good at (comfortable work), and you may end up with some work that you're overqualified for, or is boring, but that just needs to get done (mundane).

We should work together to make sure you have enough ambitious work that you are challenged and growing, if you're not learning something new every sprint, that's something we should work on together. We also want to minimize your mundane work. Often, your mundane work may be someone else's ambitious work.

An exercise with this model is to simply list the work you do in a sprint and then classify it into the three categories. The list should have a balance of enough Ambitious work that you're not overwhelmed, and little of the Mundane work - with Comfortable work to fill the gap. If the balance is off, we should discuss in a 1:1, as there's likely a way to find balance by shifting work around, discovering new work, or stopping work on some items entirely.

### On Candor
This company may require me to not tell you about something. This company cannot require me to lie to you. I would not abide by such a requirement.
I bias toward transparency and candor.  You can ask anything.  Most of the time, I'll answer.  Rarely, I won't.  I'm committed to never lying to you

I hope this README gives you some answers to me. Maybe questions you hadn't even thought of yet, but could be useful to know anyhow. Thanks for reading.
