    <h2>Does this model fit us?</h2>

    <p>After reading HGTS, it became obvious to me that Google is a large enough company; with a complex enough
        product line that one model does NOT fit all cases.
    </p>

    <p>In general, the web product teams (like gMail, Google plus, gMaps, etc.) are similar to us, and those are
        the
        examples I drew comparisons with.
        Others that are more different than similar included youTube (slight overlap), Chrome (slight overlap)
        and
        Android (OS/Apps side, but not hardware side)
    </p>

            <li>Designers, Product Owners and User Experience Experts</li>
            <li>There was no direct mention as to weather SWEs pair programmed</li>
            <li>There was mentions of pull requests and code reviews</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a Software Productivity Team (what replaced QA).
            <li>There is a Engineering Productivity team</li>
            <li>There are Software Engineering & Productivity managers and directors, and there is a hierarchy for

    <h2>How Google Teams are NOT organized:</h2>

    <p>There is NOT a Quality Assurance team, or a Testing Team, or Testing Services because this created a
        'over the wall, or safety net' environment. </p>

    <p>Instead, each team (comprised primarily of SWEs, and a few STEs, and occasionally some TEs) own the
        quality of their product.

    <p>There was NO mention of Architects, QA, ScrumMasters, or Project Management, or PMO office, or Change Control</p>

        <li>They are highly skilled</li>
        <li>They have 20% time to reinvest in learning / contributing</li>
        <li>There seems to be a lot of time spent on design documents?</li>

            <li> Works in a test driven development model</li>
            <li>Creates unit tests for code, javascript, etc.</li>
            <li>Creates spec tests that may test with browsers</li>
            <li>They may build mocks or fakes for unit tests to interact with</li>
            <li>SWEs own the quality of the product they build, there is no 2nd team acting as a QA last check
                safety net.
            </li>
            <li>SWEs fix the bugs that are found in their products</li>
            <li>They submit ‘change sets’ of code</li>
            <li>They perform code reviews</li>

        <h2>Does MapQuest have SWE's ? </h2>

        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: green;">Yes</h3>

        <p>This maps very closely to our idea of Software Engineers. Basic responsibilities include feature
            story interpretation, code architecture, functional code creation, product architecture, and health
            monitoring.

                test frameworks (like rspec/capbybara/selenium) javascript test frameworks (jasmine)
            </li>
            <li> Contribute to building, reviewing, and extending unit tests</li>
            <li> May build mocks and fakes for unit tests to interact with</li>
            <li> May build custom tools when needed (java/ruby test code?)</li>
            <li> May contribute to functional code occasionally</li>

        <h2>Does Mapquest have SET's ?</h2>

        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">No</h3>

        <p>Not presently dedicated full time. We do have more technically oriented test engineers than some.
            We do have Software Engineers that take the 'lead' on implementing 'best practices' and tools for the
            benefit of the team, and contributing
            to a better quality software development process.

            <li>Perform risk analysis of features / products in order to guide the team in where to test, and how
                much to test based on what is most important
            </li>
            <li>Perform organized, exploratory testing</li>

    <h2>Software process:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SETs help build testing frameworks and more tests that fit the needs of the product</li>
        <li>TDD code is written</li>
        <li>Code is completed in Change Sets, and submitted to source control</li>
        <li>Some magic tool is used to analyze change sets, and determine what set of tests need to be run (across
            multiple products) based on what has a dependency on the changed code
        </li>
        <li>SWEs run the identified, custom test suite to verify code change set does not introduce a regression</li>
        <li>Upon verification of green tests, the change set is submitted to a build server</li>
        <li>Further regression tests are run??</li>
        <li>TEs review change sets, and perform targeted manual testing??</li>
        <li>Code is released from HEAD.</li>

    <h1>Summary and Comments of the Chapters</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Forward/intro:</h2>

    <p>Developer unit tests are not enough, integration tests, system tests, UI tests were still needed.</p>

    <p>Google originally had a team was called “Testing Services” and focused the majority of its energy on UI
        validation and jumping into projects on an as-needed basis. It was later changed info “Engineering
        Productivity”</p>
</section>

<section>
    <section>
        <h2>Chapter 1. Introduction to Google Software Testing:</h2>

        <p style="font-style:italic; color: #4682b4;">“Testing must not create friction that slows down innovation and
            development.“</p>

        <p><span style="color: #27b48b;">My thoughts:</span> We need to question everything we do
            with a value proposition. Does it add value? And
            if so, for whom? The developer? Product owner? Customer? AOL? We need to be willing to accept that 80% fast
            is
            often what is asked of us. Minimum Viable Product. Knowing we probably don’t have it right anyway, so let’s
            plan
            to iterate soon to make it better, and react as needed when we know more.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <p style="font-style:italic; color: #4682b4;">“If you are an engineer, you are a tester. If you are an engineer
            with the word test in your title, then you
            are an enabler of good testing for those other engineers who do not.”</p>

        <p><span style="color: #27b48b;">My thoughts:</span> Later on, this book acknowledges a
            difference between software coders, and testers. Coders are
            focused
            on creating a solution, with minimum complexity and effort, so that they can do more of the same again
            tomorrow.
            A code writing “optimist”.</p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <p style="font-style:italic; color: #4682b4;">A tester is looking to find breakage in a product. They look for
            ways to demonstrate assumptions that are
            lacking, or an interface that is not clear to a user, or software that does not work as assumed it would in
            other cases.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #27b48b;">My thoughts:</span> Testers looks for holes, gaps, etc. finding places where
            bugs exist. Testers take this “pessimist” attitude
            and use it to help SWEs learn how to live in both worlds. The goal is <span style="color: #ffa65b;">NOT TO
            PROVIDE QUALITY ASSURANCE</span> to them, but to help demonstrate problems in the app that need fixed
            (bugs). And
            to help them switch to this way of thinking when needed. This chapter further asserts: “If you are an
            engineer, you are a tester”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <p>“Although it is true that quality cannot be tested in, it is equally evident that without testing, it is
            impossible to develop anything of quality.”</p>

        <p>Comment: confirming that quality has to be thought be the code creators, and even the best code will have
            assumptions, which often lead to bugs. Testing, and thinking through ways to break the code help uncover the
            assumptions.
        </p>
    </section>

<section>
    <section>
        <h2>What QA needs to hear in order to make this transition:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is okay for a team to own quality by themselves</li>
            <li>Because: We will never break the 'safety net' mentality without that</li>
            <li>Management is willing to prioritize 'Faster to Market' over other concerns</li>
            <li>Because: We can get the team to own quality, thus motivating them to write their own automated tests,
                knowing that occasionally hey will release a bug, but they can find and fix it in a day or two
            </li>
    </section>
    <section>
        <li>Testers (SETs and TEs) become a scarce, valuable, and sought after resource. There are assigned as a on-loan
            status, not a entitlement to the team.
        </li>
        <li>Quality tracking of a teams release health (cost to perform a release, frequency of releases, Occurrences of
            Severity 1 bugs, frequency of production rollbacks) become the front line indicator of how well a team is
            performing
        </li>
        <li>Implement a 'Test Certified Level' program to measure/ incentivize teams to improve their quality</li>
        <li>It's okay to redefine Quality from Ownership(by a tester) to Process. This one is hard for me.</li>
        <li>It's okay to replace manual test cases with measuring/training for quality</li>
        <li>It's okay for the 'requirements' of 'What should it do?' to be documented in only a test</li>
        </ul>
